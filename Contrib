# The end of this file contains a list of "contributors" to Gini.

# Gini is licensed under open-to-individual terms.  No company, government, or
# instituation may own the right to re-license Gini(*). As a result, people
# contributing to or using Gini need not worry about being hounded by large
# organisation needs.
#
# In these terms, "Contributors" are not authors.  Rather, they are
# organisations which support the gini project in some concrete form.  Most
# often, Contributors are companies or organisations that grant individuals
# copyright ownership of their Gini-Licensed authored works found in the Gini
# project.
#
# This list should be sorted.  Each entry should be in the form <"Organisation
# Name"> <YEAR> <COUNTRY> <<contact>>
#
# Organisation Name must be quoted if it contains white space, and may be an
# individual.
#
# Year should be the first year acting as a contributor to the Gini project.
# 
# contact email should be a valid email address

# (*) The right to re-license is different than the right to use, modify, or
# redistribute.  Any entity can perform these activities at will.  However, the
# result will always hold the license under the real authors.  Our contribution
# mechanism ensures individuals (human beings) are the only type of entity
# which can become a co-owner of the copyrights.  We are thinking about
# including AI/software as owner of copyrights provided it is licensed under
# owned-by-author-who-are-real-people terms.
