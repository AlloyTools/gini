# This file contains the offical list of copyright owners of Gini, which due to
# gini contribution policy is the same thing as the actual authors.
# 
# The gini project only accepts copyright ownership by individuals.  
#
# This list should be kept sorted, and each entry should be in the following
# form:
#
# <"Individual Name"> <Year of initial contribution> <Comma-Separated list of
# Countries of Residence (use * if not a resident of any country)> <contact
# email>
#
# Countries of residence should be in ISO-3166 form unless the author is not a
# resident (eg lives on the international space station or a failed state
# during first year of contribution)
